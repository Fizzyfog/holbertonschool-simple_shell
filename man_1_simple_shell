.SH NAME
.B hsh
- A simple command line interpreter (Simple Shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh [options] [command_string | file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B hsh
is an sh-compatible command language interpreter. It reads and executes
commands from the standard input or a file. This shell is based on the original
UNIX shell. It has been adapted to our needs for the simple shell project
at Holberton School and does not offer all the features of the original shell.

.SH OVERVIEW
The shell reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.
It is invoked by the command: $./hsh. A prompt will appear for the user to enter
and execute commands by typing command names and pressing the return key.
A user can also pipe commands into the program via the pipe character '|'. For example: $ echo "hello world" | ./hsh
